-🌹Hello, my name is Rosa Miranda Gomez.  
-🖥️I am a masters student in Computer Engineering at San Diego State University.  
-🎛️I am interested in computer networks and embedded devices.   
-🗼Because I only minored in computer science at UCSD, I have less experience in the technical/engineering side of the program.  
-🛜I have a little more experience in computer networks, Java and C++ coding.   
-🍽️When I am not catching up on homework or working, I like to play board games, hang out with my friends and try new places to eat.
